I just edited the file /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-libinput.conf and added the Option "NaturalScrolling" "true" entry in the first section:

Section "InputClass"
Identifier "libinput pointer catchall"
MatchIsPointer "on"
MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
Driver "libinput"
Option "NaturalScrolling" "true"
EndSection
